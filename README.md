# recent-list

Quick access to recently opened projects.

## Features

- **Recent list**: browse and open recently opened projects.
- **Multiple open modes**: open in a new window, swap, switch in the same window, or append to the current window.
- **Dev and safe mode**: open projects in dev mode or safe mode directly from the list.
- **Visual indicators**: items configured with dev mode or safe mode are marked with distinct icons.
- **Recency-aware filtering**: fuzzy matching adjusts scores with a recency bonus and a shallower-path bonus.

## Services

- **[recent-list](docs/recent-list.md)** (`1.0.0`): provided to expose the recent projects list manager so other packages can open the list without depending on the toggle command.

## Customization

Resize the results panel by adding CSS to your `styles.css`:

```css

  .list-group {
    max-height: 20em;
  }
}
```
